[Axios Docs](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

#### express-async-errors

The "express-async-errors" package is an Express.js middleware that helps handle errors that occur within asynchronous functions. It catches unhandled errors inside async/await functions and forwards them to Express.js's error handling middleware, preventing the Node.js process from crashing. It simplifies error handling in Express.js applications by allowing you to write asynchronous code without worrying about manually catching and forwarding errors.

[Express Async Errors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-errors)

#### Status Codes

A library for HTTP status codes is useful because it provides a comprehensive and standardized set of codes that represent the outcome of HTTP requests. It allows developers to easily understand and handle different scenarios during web development, such as successful responses, client or server errors, redirects, and more. By using a status code library, developers can ensure consistent and reliable communication between servers and clients, leading to better error handling and improved user experience.

[Http Status Codes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status-codes)

200 OK OK
201 CREATED Created

400 BAD_REQUEST Bad Request
401 UNAUTHORIZED Unauthorized

403 FORBIDDEN Forbidden
404 NOT_FOUND Not Found

500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR Internal Server Error

#### Validation Layer

[Express Validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)

#### Hash Passwords

[bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)

##### BCRYPT VS BCRYPTJS

bcrypt and bcryptjs are both popular libraries for hashing passwords in Node.js applications. However, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for a few reasons:

Cross-platform compatibility: bcrypt is a native Node.js module that uses C++ bindings, which can make it difficult to install and use on some platforms. bcryptjs, on the other hand, is a pure JavaScript implementation that works on any platform.

Security: While both bcrypt and bcryptjs use the same underlying algorithm for hashing passwords, bcryptjs is designed to be more resistant to certain types of attacks, such as side-channel attacks.

Ease of use: bcryptjs has a simpler and more intuitive API than bcrypt, which can make it easier to use and integrate into your application.

Overall, while bcrypt and bcryptjs are both good choices for hashing passwords in Node.js applications, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for its cross-platform compatibility, improved security, ease of use, and ongoing maintenance.

#### JSON Web Token

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact and secure way of transmitting data between parties. It is often used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and APIs. JWTs contain information about the user and additional metadata, and can be used to securely transmit this information

[Useful Resource](https://jwt.io/introduction)
JWT_SECRET represents the secret key used to sign the JWT. When creating a JWT, the payload (data) is signed with this secret key to generate a unique token. The secret key should be kept secure and should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

JWT_EXPIRES_IN specifies the expiration time for the JWT. It determines how long the token remains valid before it expires. The value of JWT_EXPIRES_IN is typically provided as a duration, such as "1h" for one hour or "7d" for seven days. Once the token expires, it is no longer considered valid and can't be used for authentication or authorization purposes.

These environment variables (JWT_SECRET and JWT_EXPIRES_IN) are read from the system environment during runtime, allowing for flexibility in configuration without modifying the code.

#### Test JWT (optional)

[JWT](https://jwt.io/)

#### HTTP Only Cookie

An HTTP-only cookie is a cookie that can't be accessed by JavaScript running in the browser. It is designed to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to steal cookies and other sensitive information.

##### HTTP Only Cookie VS Local Storage

An HTTP-only cookie is a type of cookie that is designed to be inaccessible to JavaScript running in the browser. It is primarily used for authentication purposes and is a more secure way of storing sensitive information like user tokens. Local storage, on the other hand, is a browser-based storage mechanism that is accessible to JavaScript, and is used to store application data like preferences or user-generated content. While local storage is convenient, it is not a secure way of storing sensitive information as it can be accessed and modified by JavaScript running in the browser.

##### Cookie Parser

[Cookie Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)

Package: helmet
Description: helmet is a security package for Express.js applications that helps protect them by setting various HTTP headers to enhance security, prevent common web vulnerabilities, and improve overall application security posture.
Need: The package is needed to safeguard web applications from potential security threats, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, clickjacking, and other security exploits.

Package: express-mongo-sanitize
Description: express-mongo-sanitize is a middleware for Express.js that sanitizes user-supplied data coming from request parameters, body, and query strings to prevent potential NoSQL injection attacks on MongoDB databases.
Need: The package addresses the need to protect MongoDB databases from malicious attempts to manipulate data and helps ensure the integrity of data storage and retrieval.

Package: express-rate-limit
Description: express-rate-limit is an Express.js middleware that helps control and limit the rate of incoming requests from a specific IP address or a set of IP addresses to protect the server from abuse, brute-force attacks, and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Need: This package is necessary to manage and regulate the number of requests made to the server within a given time frame, preventing excessive usage and improving the overall stability and performance of the application.

  res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({ msg: "user updated" });
};
```

```json
{
  "name": "john",
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "lastName": "smith",
  "location": "florida"
}
```

#### Application Stats

```js
export const getApplicationStats = async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.countDocuments();
  const jobs = await Job.countDocuments();
  res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({ users, jobs });
};
```

```js
export const authorizePermissions = (...roles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      throw new UnauthorizedError("Unauthorized to access this route");
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

```js
import { authorizePermissions } from "../middleware/authMiddleware.js";

router.get("/admin/app-stats", [
  authorizePermissions("admin"),
  getApplicationStats,
]);
```

#### Setup Proxy

- only in dev env
- a must since cookies are sent back to the same server
- spin up both servers (our own and vite dev)

- server

```sh
npm run dev
```

- vite dev server

```sh
cd client && npm run dev
```

server.js

```js
app.get("/api/v1/test", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ msg: "test route" });
});
```

client/src/main.jsx

```js
fetch("http://localhost:5100/api/v1/test")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

client/vite.config.js

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:5100/api",
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ""),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

main.jsx

```js
fetch("/api/v1/test")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

This code configures a proxy rule for the development server, specifically for requests that start with /api. Let's go through each property:

'/api': This is the path to match. If a request is made to the development server with a path that starts with /api, the proxy rule will be applied.
target: 'http://localhost:5100/api': This specifies the target URL where the requests will be redirected. In this case, any request that matches the /api path will be forwarded to http://localhost:5100/api.

changeOrigin: true: When set to true, this property changes the origin of the request to match the target URL. This can be useful when working with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''): This property allows you to modify the path of the request before it is forwarded to the target. In this case, the rewrite function uses a regular expression (/^\/api/) to remove the /api prefix from the path. For example, if a request is made to /api/users, the rewritten path will be /users.

To summarize, these lines of code configure a proxy rule for requests starting with /api on the development server. The requests will be redirected to http://localhost:5100/api, with the /api prefix removed from the path.

```sh
npm i concurrently@8.0.1
```

```json
"scripts": {
    "setup-project": "npm i && cd client && npm i",
    "server": "nodemon server",
    "client": "cd client && npm run dev",
    "dev": "concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \" npm run server\" \" npm run client\""
  },
```

By default, when a command fails, concurrently continues running the remaining commands. However, when --kill-others-on-fail is specified, if any of the commands fail, concurrently will immediately terminate all the other running commands.

```sh
npm i axios@1.3.6
```

main.jsx

```js
import axios from "axios";

const data = await axios.get("/api/v1/test");
console.log(data);
```

#### Custom Instance

utils/customFetch.js

```js
import axios from "axios";
const customFetch = axios.create({
  baseURL: "/api/v1",
});

export default customFetch;
```

main.jsx

```js
import customFetch from "./utils/customFetch.js";

const data = await customFetch.get("/test");
console.log(data);
```

#### Typical Form Submission

```js
import { useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";
const MyForm = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const data = await axios.post("url", { value });
  };

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>.....</form>;
};

export default MyForm;
```

#### React Router - Action

Route actions are the "writes" to route loader "reads". They provide a way for apps to perform data mutations with simple HTML and HTTP semantics while React Router abstracts away the complexity of asynchronous UI and revalidation. This gives you the simple mental model of HTML + HTTP (where the browser handles the asynchrony and revalidation) with the behavior and UX capabilities of modern SPAs.

Register.jsx

```js
import { Form, redirect, useNavigation, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import Wrapper from "../assets/wrappers/RegisterAndLoginPage";
import { FormRow, Logo } from "../components";

const Register = () => {
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Form method="post" className="form">
        ...
      </Form>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
export default Register;
```

App.jsx

```jsx
{
  path: 'register',
  element: <Register />,
  action: () => {
   console.log('hello there');
   return null;
    },
},
```

#### Register User

- FormData API

[FormData API - JS Nuggets](https://youtu.be/5-x4OUM-SP8)
[FormData API - React ](https://youtu.be/WrX5RndZIzw)

Register.jsx

```js
export const action = async ({ request }) => {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
  try {
    await customFetch.post("/auth/register", data);
    return redirect("/login");
  } catch (error) {
    return error;
  }
};
```

App.jsx

```jsx
import { action as registerAction } from './pages/Register';

{
  path: 'register',
  element: <Register />,
  action:registerAction
},
```

#### useNavigation() and navigation.state

This hook tells you everything you need to know about a page navigation to build pending navigation indicators and optimistic UI on data mutations. Things like:

- Global loading indicators
- Adding busy indicators to submit buttons

Navigation State

idle - There is no navigation pending.
submitting - A route action is being called due to a form submission using POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE
loading - The loaders for the next routes are being called to render the next page

Register.jsx

```js
const Register = () => {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const isSubmitting = navigation.state === "submitting";
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Form method="post" className="form">
        ....
        <button type="submit" className="btn btn-block" disabled={isSubmitting}>
          {isSubmitting ? "submitting..." : "submit"}
        </button>
        ...
      </Form>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
export default Register;
```

#### React-Toastify

    toast.error(error?.response?.data?.msg);
    return error;
  }
};
```

#### Login User

```js
import { Link, Form, redirect, useNavigation } from "react-router-dom";
import Wrapper from "../assets/wrappers/RegisterAndLoginPage";
import { FormRow, Logo } from "../components";
import customFetch from "../utils/customFetch";

    return errors;
  }
  try {
    await customFetch.post("/auth/login", data);
    toast.success("Login successful");
    return redirect("/dashboard");
  } catch (error) {

        ...
      </Form>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
export default Login;
```

#### Get Current User

Each route can define a "loader" function to provide data to the route element before it renders.

- must return a value

DashboardLayout.jsx

```jsx
import { Outlet, redirect, useLoaderData } from 'react-router-dom';
import customFetch from '../utils/customFetch';

export const loader = async () => {
  try {
    const { data } = await customFetch('/users/current-user');
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    return redirect('/');
  }
};


const DashboardLayout = ({ isDarkThemeEnabled }) => {
  const { user } = useLoaderData();

  return (
    <DashboardContext.Provider
      value={{
        user,
        showSidebar,
        isDarkTheme,
        toggleDarkTheme,
        toggleSidebar,
        logoutUser,
      }}
    >
      <Wrapper>
        <main className='dashboard'>
         ...
            <div className='dashboard-page'>
              <Outlet context={{ user }} />
            </div>
          </div>
        </main>
      </Wrapper>
    </DashboardContext.Provider>
  );
};
export const useDashboardContext = () => useContext(DashboardContext);
export default DashboardLayout;

```

#### Logout User

DashboardLayout.jsx

```js
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { toast } from "react-toastify";

const DashboardLayout = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const logoutUser = async () => {
    navigate("/");
    await customFetch.get("/auth/logout");
    toast.success("Logging out...");
  };

  const formData = await request.formData();

  const file = formData.get("avatar");
  if (file && file.size > 500000) {
    toast.error("Image size too large");
    return null;

  try {
    await customFetch.patch("/users/update-user", formData);
    toast.success("Profile updated successfully");

    toast.error(error?.response?.data?.msg);
  }
  return null;
};
```

#### Update User - Server

```sh
npm i multer@1.4.5
```

Multer is a popular middleware package for handling multipart/form-data in Node.js web applications. It is commonly used for handling file uploads. Multer simplifies the process of accepting and storing files submitted through HTTP requests by providing an easy-to-use API. It integrates seamlessly with Express.js and allows developers to define upload destinations, file size limits, and other configurations.

- create middleware/multerMiddleware.js
- setup multer

```js
import multer from "multer";

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    // set the directory where uploaded files will be stored
    cb(null, "public/uploads");
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const fileName = file.originalname;
    // set the name of the uploaded file
    cb(null, fileName);
  },
});
const upload = multer({ storage });

export default upload;
```

routes/userRouter.js

```js
import upload from "../middleware/multerMiddleware.js";

router.patch(
  "/update-user",
  upload.single("avatar"),
  validateUpdateUserInput,
  updateUser
);
```

First, the multer package is imported.

Then, a storage object is created using multer.diskStorage(). This object specifies the configuration for storing uploaded files. In this case, the destination function determines the directory where the uploaded files will be saved, which is set to 'public/uploads'. The filename function defines the name of the uploaded file, which is set to the original filename.

Next, a multer middleware is created by passing the storage object as a configuration option. This multer middleware will be used to handle file uploads in the application.

In this case, upload is an instance of the Multer middleware that was created earlier. The .single() method is called on this instance to indicate that only one file will be uploaded. The argument 'avatar' specifies the name of the field in the HTTP request that corresponds to the uploaded file.

When this middleware is used in an HTTP route handler, it will process the incoming request and extract the file attached to the 'avatar' field. Multer will then save the file according to the specified storage configuration, which includes the destination directory and filename logic defined earlier. The uploaded file can be accessed in the route handler using req.file.

#### Stats - Complete Server Functionality

[MongoDB Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/)

The MongoDB aggregation pipeline is like a factory line for data. Data enters, it goes through different stages like cleaning, sorting, or grouping, and comes out at the end changed in some way. It's a way to process data inside MongoDB.

jobController.js

```js
export const showStats = async (req, res) => {
  let stats = await Job.aggregate([
    { $match: { createdBy: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId) } },
    { $group: { _id: "$jobStatus", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  ]);
  stats = stats.reduce((acc, curr) => {
    const { _id: title, count } = curr;
    acc[title] = count;
    return acc;
  }, {});

  const defaultStats = {
    pending: stats.pending || 0,
    interview: stats.interview || 0,
    declined: stats.declined || 0,
  };

  let monthlyApplications = await Job.aggregate([
    { $match: { createdBy: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId) } },
    {
      $group: {
        _id: { year: { $year: "$createdAt" }, month: { $month: "$createdAt" } },
        count: { $sum: 1 },
      },
    },
    { $sort: { "_id.year": -1, "_id.month": -1 } },
    { $limit: 6 },
  ]);
  monthlyApplications = monthlyApplications
    .map((item) => {
      const {
        _id: { year, month },
        count,
      } = item;

      const date = day()
        .month(month - 1)
        .year(year)
        .format("MMM YY");
      return { date, count };
    })
    .reverse();

  res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({ defaultStats, monthlyApplications });
};
```

#### Commentary

```js
let stats = await Job.aggregate([
  { $match: { createdBy: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId) } },
  { $group: { _id: "$jobStatus", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
]);
```

let stats = await Job.aggregate([ ... ]); This line says we're going to perform an aggregation operation on the Job collection in MongoDB and save the result in a variable called stats. The await keyword is used to wait for the operation to finish before continuing, as the operation is asynchronous (i.e., it runs in the background).

{ $match: { createdBy: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId) } } This is the first stage of the pipeline. It filters the jobs so that only the ones created by the user specified by req.user.userId are passed to the next stage. The new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId) part converts req.user.userId into an ObjectId (which is the format MongoDB uses for ids).

{ $group: { _id: '$jobStatus', count: { $sum: 1 } } } This is the second stage of the pipeline. It groups the remaining jobs by their status (the jobStatus field). For each group, it calculates the count of jobs by adding 1 for each job ({ $sum: 1 }), and stores this in a field called count.

```js
let monthlyApplications = await Job.aggregate([
  { $match: { createdBy: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId) } },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: { year: { $year: "$createdAt" }, month: { $month: "$createdAt" } },
      count: { $sum: 1 },
    },
  },
  { $sort: { "_id.year": -1, "_id.month": -1 } },
  { $limit: 6 },
]);
```

let monthlyApplications = await Job.aggregate([ ... ]); This line indicates that an aggregation operation will be performed on the Job collection in MongoDB. The result will be stored in the variable monthlyApplications. The await keyword ensures that the code waits for this operation to complete before proceeding, as it is an asynchronous operation.

{ $match: { createdBy: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId) } } This is the first stage of the pipeline. It filters the jobs to only those created by the user identified by req.user.userId.

{ $group: { _id: { year: { $year: '$createdAt' }, month: { $month: '$createdAt' } }, count: { $sum: 1 } } } This is the second stage of the pipeline. It groups the remaining jobs based on the year and month when they were created. For each group, it calculates the count of jobs by adding 1 for each job in the group.

{ $sort: { '\_id.year': -1, '\_id.month': -1 } } This is the third stage of the pipeline. It sorts the groups by year and month in descending order. The -1 indicates descending order. So it starts with the most recent year and month.

{ $limit: 6 } This is the fourth and last stage of the pipeline. It limits the output to the top 6 groups, after sorting. This is effectively getting the job count for the last 6 months.

So, monthlyApplications will be an array with up to 6 elements, each representing the number of jobs created by the user in a specific month and year. The array will be sorted by year and month, starting with the most recent.

#### Stats - Front-End Setup

- create four components
- StatsContainer and ChartsContainer (import/export)
- AreaChart, BarChart (local)

pages/Stats.jsx

```js
import { ChartsContainer, StatsContainer } from "../components";
import customFetch from "../utils/customFetch";
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";
export const loader = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await customFetch.get("/jobs/stats");
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    return error;
  }
};

const Stats = () => {
  const { defaultStats, monthlyApplications } = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <>
      <StatsContainer defaultStats={defaultStats} />
      {monthlyApplications?.length > 0 && (
        <ChartsContainer data={monthlyApplications} />
      )}
    </>
  );
};
export default Stats;
```

#### Stats Container

  }
`;

export default Wrapper;
```

#### Get All Jobs - Server

jobController.js

Query parameters, also known as query strings or URL parameters, are used to pass information to a web server through the URL of a webpage. They are typically appended to the end of a URL after a question mark (?) and separated by ampersands (&). Query parameters consist of a key-value pair, where the key represents the parameter name and the value represents the corresponding data being passed. They are commonly used in web applications to provide additional context or parameters for server-side processing or to filter and sort data.

```js
export const getAllJobs = async (req, res) => {
  const { search, jobStatus, jobType, sort } = req.query;

  const queryObject = {
    createdBy: req.user.userId,
  };

  if (search) {
    queryObject.$or = [
      { position: { $regex: search, $options: "i" } },
      { company: { $regex: search, $options: "i" } },
    ];
  }
  if (jobStatus && jobStatus !== "all") {
    queryObject.jobStatus = jobStatus;
  }
  if (jobType && jobType !== "all") {
    queryObject.jobType = jobType;
  }

  const sortOptions = {
    newest: "-createdAt",
    oldest: "createdAt",
    "a-z": "position",
    "z-a": "-position",
  };

  const sortKey = sortOptions[sort] || sortOptions.newest;

  // setup pagination
  const page = Number(req.query.page) || 1;
  const limit = Number(req.query.limit) || 10;
  const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

  const jobs = await Job.find(queryObject)
    .sort(sortKey)
    .skip(skip)
    .limit(limit);

  const totalJobs = await Job.countDocuments(queryObject);
  const numOfPages = Math.ceil(totalJobs / limit);

  res
    .status(StatusCodes.OK)
    .json({ totalJobs, numOfPages, currentPage: page, jobs });
};
```

#### Search Container

- setup log in AllJobs loader

```js
import { FormRow, FormRowSelect, SubmitBtn } from ".";
import Wrapper from "../assets/wrappers/DashboardFormPage";
import { Form, useSubmit, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { JOB_TYPE, JOB_STATUS, JOB_SORT_BY } from "../../../utils/constants";
import { useAllJobsContext } from "../pages/AllJobs";

const SearchContainer = () => {
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Form className="form">
        <h5 className="form-title">search form</h5>
        <div className="form-center">
          {/* search position */}

          <FormRow type="search" name="search" defaultValue="a" />
          <FormRowSelect
            labelText="job status"
            name="jobStatus"
            list={["all", ...Object.values(JOB_STATUS)]}
            defaultValue="all"
          />
          <FormRowSelect
            labelText="job type"
            name="jobType"
            list={["all", ...Object.values(JOB_TYPE)]}
            defaultValue="all"
          />
          <FormRowSelect
            name="sort"
            defaultValue="newest"
            list={[...Object.values(JOB_SORT_BY)]}
          />

          <Link to="/dashboard/all-jobs" className="btn form-btn delete-btn">
            Reset Search Values
          </Link>
          {/* TEMP!!!! */}
          <SubmitBtn formBtn />
        </div>
      </Form>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};

export default SearchContainer;
```

#### All Jobs Loader

AllJobs.jsx

```js
import { toast } from "react-toastify";
import { JobsContainer, SearchContainer } from "../components";
import customFetch from "../utils/customFetch";
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";
import { useContext, createContext } from "react";
const AllJobsContext = createContext();
export const loader = async ({ request }) => {
  try {
    const params = Object.fromEntries([
      ...new URL(request.url).searchParams.entries(),
    ]);

    const { data } = await customFetch.get("/jobs", {
      params,
    });

    return {
      data,
      searchValues: { ...params },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error(error.response.data.msg);
    return error;
  }
};

const AllJobs = () => {
  const { data, searchValues } = useLoaderData();

  return (
    <AllJobsContext.Provider value={{ data, searchValues }}>
      <SearchContainer />
      <JobsContainer />
    </AllJobsContext.Provider>
  );
};
export default AllJobs;

export const useAllJobsContext = () => useContext(AllJobsContext);
```

```js
const params = Object.fromEntries([
  ...new URL(request.url).searchParams.entries(),
]);
```

new URL(request.url): This creates a new URL object by passing the request.url to the URL constructor. The URL object provides various methods and properties to work with URLs.

.searchParams: The searchParams property of the URL object gives you access to the query parameters in the URL. It is an instance of the URLSearchParams class, which provides methods to manipulate and access the parameters.

.entries(): The entries() method of searchParams returns an iterator containing arrays of key-value pairs for each query parameter. Each array contains two elements: the parameter name and its corresponding value.

([...new URL(request.url).searchParams.entries()]): The spread operator ... is used to convert the iterator obtained from searchParams.entries() into an array. This allows us to pass the array to the Object.fromEntries() method.

Object.fromEntries(): This static method creates an object from an array of key-value pairs. It takes an iterable (in this case, the array of parameter key-value pairs) and returns a new object where the keys and values are derived from the iterable.

Putting it all together, the code retrieves the URL from the request.url property, extracts the search parameters using the searchParams property, converts them into an array of key-value pairs using entries(), and finally uses Object.fromEntries() to create an object with the parameter names as keys and their corresponding values. The resulting object, params, contains all the search parameters from the URL.

#### Submit Form Programmatically

- setup default values from the context
- remove SubmitBtn
- add onChange to FormRow, FormRowSelect and all inputs

SearchContainer.js

```js
import { FormRow, FormRowSelect } from ".";
import Wrapper from "../assets/wrappers/DashboardFormPage";
import { Form, useSubmit, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { JOB_TYPE, JOB_STATUS, JOB_SORT_BY } from "../../../utils/constants";
import { useAllJobsContext } from "../pages/AllJobs";
const SearchContainer = () => {
  const { searchValues } = useAllJobsContext();
  const { search, jobStatus, jobType, sort } = searchValues;

  const submit = useSubmit();

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Form className="form">
        <h5 className="form-title">search form</h5>
        <div className="form-center">
          {/* search position */}

          <FormRow
            type="search"
            name="search"
            defaultValue={search}
            onChange={(e) => {
              submit(e.currentTarget.form);
            }}
          />
          <FormRowSelect
            labelText="job status"
            name="jobStatus"
            list={["all", ...Object.values(JOB_STATUS)]}
            defaultValue={jobStatus}
            onChange={(e) => {
              submit(e.currentTarget.form);
            }}
          />
          <FormRowSelect
            labelText="job type"
            name="jobType"
            defaultValue={jobType}
            list={["all", ...Object.values(JOB_TYPE)]}
            onChange={(e) => {
              submit(e.currentTarget.form);
            }}
          />
          <FormRowSelect
            name="sort"
            defaultValue={sort}
            list={[...Object.values(JOB_SORT_BY)]}
            onChange={(e) => {
              submit(e.currentTarget.form);
            }}
          />
          <Link to="/dashboard/all-jobs" className="btn form-btn delete-btn">
            Reset Search Values
          </Link>
        </div>
      </Form>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};

export default SearchContainer;
```

#### Debounce

[JS Nuggets - Debounce](https://youtu.be/tYx6pXdvt1s)

In JavaScript, debounce is a way to limit how often a function gets called. It helps prevent rapid or repeated function executions by introducing a delay. This is useful for tasks like handling user input, where you want to wait for a pause before triggering an action to avoid unnecessary processing.

```js
const debounce = (onChange) => {
  let timeout;
  return (e) => {
    const form = e.currentTarget.form;
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      onChange(form);
    }, 2000);
  };
};
<FormRow
  type="search"
  name="search"
  defaultValue={search}
  onChange={debounce((form) => {
    submit(form);
  })}
/>;
```

#### Pagination - Setup

- create PageBtnContainer

JobsContainer.jsx

```js
import Job from "./Job";
import Wrapper from "../assets/wrappers/JobsContainer";
import PageBtnContainer from "./PageBtnContainer";
import { useAllJobsContext } from "../pages/AllJobs";

const JobsContainer = () => {
  const { data } = useAllJobsContext();
  const { jobs, totalJobs, numOfPages } = data;
  if (jobs.length === 0) {
    return (
      <Wrapper>
        <h2>No jobs to display...</h2>
      </Wrapper>
    );
  }

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <h5>
        {totalJobs} job{jobs.length > 1 && "s"} found
      </h5>
      <div className="jobs">
        {jobs.map((job) => {
          return <Job key={job._id} {...job} />;

export default Wrapper;
```

#### Local Build

- remove default values from inputs in Register and Login
- navigate to client and build front-end

```sh
cd client && npm run build
```

- copy/paste all the files/folders

  - from client/dist
  - to server(root)/public

- in server.js point to index.html

```js
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "./public", "index.html"));
});
```

#### Deploy On Render

[Render](https://render.com/)

- sign up of for account
- create git repository

#### Build Front-End on Render

- add script
- change path

package.json

```js
 "scripts": {
    "setup-production-app": "npm i && cd client && npm i && npm run build",
  },
```

server.js

```js
app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, "./client/dist")));

app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "./client/dist", "index.html"));
});
```

#### Test Locally

- remove client/dist and client/node_modules
- remove node_modules and package-lock.json (optional)
- run "npm run setup-production-app", followed by "node server"

#### Test in Production

- change build command on render

```sh
npm run setup-production-app
```

- push up to github

#### Upload Image As Buffer

- remove public folder

```sh
npm i datauri@4.1.0
```

middleware/multerMiddleware.js

```js
import multer from "multer";
import DataParser from "datauri/parser.js";
import path from "path";

const storage = multer.memoryStorage();
const upload = multer({ storage });

const parser = new DataParser();

export const formatImage = (file) => {
  const fileExtension = path.extname(file.originalname).toString();
  return parser.format(fileExtension, file.buffer).content;
};

export default upload;
```

controller/userController.js

```js
import { formatImage } from "../middleware/multerMiddleware.js";

export const updateUser = async (req, res) => {
  const newUser = { ...req.body };
  delete newUser.password;
  if (req.file) {
    const file = formatImage(req.file);
    const response = await cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload(file);
    newUser.avatar = response.secure_url;
    newUser.avatarPublicId = response.public_id;
  }
  const updatedUser = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.user.userId, newUser);

  if (req.file && updatedUser.avatarPublicId) {
    await cloudinary.v2.uploader.destroy(updatedUser.avatarPublicId);
  }
  res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({ msg: "update user" });
};
```

#### Setup Global Loading

- create loading component (import/export)
- check for loading in DashboardLayout page

components/Loading.jsx

```js
const Loading = () => {
  return <div className="loading"></div>;
};

export default Loading;
```

DashboardLayout.jsx

```js
import { useNavigation } from "react-router-dom";
import { Loading } from "../components";

const DashboardLayout = ({ isDarkThemeEnabled }) => {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const isPageLoading = navigation.state === "loading";

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      ...
      <div className="dashboard-page">
        {isPageLoading ? <Loading /> : <Outlet context={{ user }} />}
      </div>
      ...
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
```

- in the client

```sh
npm i @tanstack/react-query@4.29.5 @tanstack/react-query-devtools@4.29.6
```

App.jsx

#### Page Error Element

- create components/ErrorElement

Stats.jsx

App.jsx

#### First Query

- navigate to stats

Stats.jsx

const data = useQuery({ ... });: This line declares a constant variable named data and assigns it the result of the useQuery hook. The useQuery hook is provided by React Query and is used to perform data fetching.

queryKey: ['stats'],: The queryKey property is an array that serves as a unique identifier for the query. In this case, the query key is set to ['stats'], indicating that this query is fetching statistics related to jobs.

queryFn: () => customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'),: The queryFn property specifies the function that will be executed when the query is triggered. In this case, it uses an arrow function that calls customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'). The customFetch object is likely a custom wrapper around the fetch function or an external HTTP client library, used to make the actual API request to retrieve job statistics.In React Query, the queryFn property expects a function that returns a promise. The promise should resolve with the data you want to fetch and store in the query cache.

customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'): This line is making an HTTP GET request to the /jobs/stats endpoint, which is the API route that provides the job statistics data.
