#### Validation Layer

[Express Validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)

#### Hash Passwords

[bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)

##### BCRYPT VS BCRYPTJS

bcrypt and bcryptjs are both popular libraries for hashing passwords in Node.js applications. However, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for a few reasons:

Cross-platform compatibility: bcrypt is a native Node.js module that uses C++ bindings, which can make it difficult to install and use on some platforms. bcryptjs, on the other hand, is a pure JavaScript implementation that works on any platform.

Security: While both bcrypt and bcryptjs use the same underlying algorithm for hashing passwords, bcryptjs is designed to be more resistant to certain types of attacks, such as side-channel attacks.

Ease of use: bcryptjs has a simpler and more intuitive API than bcrypt, which can make it easier to use and integrate into your application.

Overall, while bcrypt and bcryptjs are both good choices for hashing passwords in Node.js applications, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for its cross-platform compatibility, improved security, ease of use, and ongoing maintenance.

#### JSON Web Token

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact and secure way of transmitting data between parties. It is often used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and APIs. JWTs contain information about the user and additional metadata, and can be used to securely transmit this information

[Useful Resource](https://jwt.io/introduction)
JWT_SECRET represents the secret key used to sign the JWT. When creating a JWT, the payload (data) is signed with this secret key to generate a unique token. The secret key should be kept secure and should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

JWT_EXPIRES_IN specifies the expiration time for the JWT. It determines how long the token remains valid before it expires. The value of JWT_EXPIRES_IN is typically provided as a duration, such as "1h" for one hour or "7d" for seven days. Once the token expires, it is no longer considered valid and can't be used for authentication or authorization purposes.

These environment variables (JWT_SECRET and JWT_EXPIRES_IN) are read from the system environment during runtime, allowing for flexibility in configuration without modifying the code.

#### Test JWT (optional)

#### HTTP Only Cookie

An HTTP-only cookie is a cookie that can't be accessed by JavaScript running in the browser. It is designed to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to steal cookies and other sensitive information.

##### HTTP Only Cookie VS Local Storage

An HTTP-only cookie is a type of cookie that is designed to be inaccessible to JavaScript running in the browser. It is primarily used for authentication purposes and is a more secure way of storing sensitive information like user tokens. Local storage, on the other hand, is a browser-based storage mechanism that is accessible to JavaScript, and is used to store application data like preferences or user-generated content. While local storage is convenient, it is not a secure way of storing sensitive information as it can be accessed and modified by JavaScript running in the browser.
